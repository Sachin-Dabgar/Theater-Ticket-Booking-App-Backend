# Movie Theater Backend

This is the backend server for the Movie Theater Ticket Booking App.

## Problem Statement

Make a Theatre ticket booking application in Node js. Let's say there are 3 screens in that theatre, each screen has 45, 60, 75 seats respectively. We should be able to book tickets of different shows. At the same time there can be Three shows running. We should be able to select the seat number while booking the ticket. We should be able to cancel the ticket. If the seats are full, it should show suggestions on the next available shows. Already booked seat can't be booked again unless the booking is cancelled.

## Here are the steps to run this backend application in your system.
